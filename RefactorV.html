                        <h3>Who was Socrates?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        <span>S</span>ocrates was born <span>469BC</span>
                        in Athens and died in <span>399 BCE</span>. He was an ancient Greek philosopher. His lifestyle,
                        character,
                        and thoughts have had a profound impact on both ancient and modern philosophy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considering Socrates wasn't one to write anything,
                        most of our understanding of his personality and teachings primarily
                        comes from the dialogues of Plato, the Memorabilia of Xenophon, and various writings of
                        Aristotle. Socrates was a brave soldier in the Peloponnesian War and later served in the
                        Athenian
                        assembly.

                    <p>
                        Socrates believed it was his religious duty to encourage his fellow citizens to lead an
                        examinedlife by
                        engaging them in philosophical conversations. His contribution to these discussions often
                        involved a
                        series of probing questions that gradually exposed his conversation partner's complete lack of
                        knowledge
                        on the subject. This teaching technique is known as the "Socratic method."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite often claiming ignorance on many subjects he explored, mainly ethical ones,
                        Socrates held certain beliefs with conviction. These included the idea that human wisdom begins
                        with
                        recognizing one's own ignorance, that an unexamined life is not worth living, that ethical
                        virtue is the
                        only thing that matters, and that a good person can never be harmed because their virtue
                        remains intact regardless of misfortune.
                    </p>

                        Among his students and admirers were Plato, Alcibiades, who betrayed Athens in the
                        Peloponnesian
                        War, and Critias, one of the Thirty Tyrants imposed on Athens after its defeat by
                        Sparta. Socrates'
                        association with these men, along with his habit of exposing the ignorance of his fellow
                        citizens,
                        made him widely disliked and feared. As a result, Socrates was tried on charges of
                        impiety and
                        corrupting the youth and was sentenced to death by poisoning (likely hemlock) in 399
                        BCE, a sentence
                        he accepted willingly.

                        <h3>The Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            <span>P</span>lato's Apology is believed to be the speech Socrates
                            gave in his defense. As portrayed in
                            the
                            Apology, Socrates' trial and death raise important questions about democracy, the value of
                            free
                            speech, and the potential conflict between moral and religious obligations and the laws of
                            the
                            state.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Plato’s Apology(29a-b), Socrates agues that he does not fear death; indeed, to fear death
                            is a sign of
                            ignorance. It is to claim to know what one in fact does not know (Ap. 29 a-b). Perhaps,
                            Socrates suggests,
                            death is not a great evil after all, but "the greatest of all goods.” At the end of the
                            dialogue, after
                            the judges have voted on the final verdict and Socrates has received the death penalty, the
                            philosopher
                            considers two common views of death: that death is a long dreamless sleep and that death is
                            a journey to
                            another place - Hades. According to Socrates, either of these views of death would be
                            acceptable to him;
                            the one, because he would receive a wonderful rest with no dreams to disturb him; the other,
                            because he
                            would be able to talk philosophy with those who had gone before with impunity.

                        <h3>The Paintings</h3>
                        <p>
                            <span>T</span>he Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate)
                            is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting was
                            part of the neoclassical style, popular in the 1780s, that depicted subjects from the
                            Classical age,
                            in this case the story ofthe execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo. In this
                            story,
                            Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods,
                            and has
                            been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson
                            for
                            his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo
                            depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the
                            philosopher's
                            final days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.

						Authors Thoughts

						When I first started this project for
						freeCodeCamp's
						Responsive Web Design course, I originally wanted to use
						Fredrich Neitszche, not that there is anything wrong with Neitszche. I just felt there were already a
						ton of
						pages dedicated to him and I wanted to learn about someone new. I had heard Socrates was one of the
						originals so
						i figured id dive into who he was and what his gig was. I found Socrates to be a a nice release from the
						philosophy i have tried to dive into before. He questioned everything, which is something I believe is
						Important. His morals intrigued me and felt familiar It is said the he had said "" I believe asking
						questions is
						where we gain not only knowledge but also Character. I found Socrates to be an interesting subject to
						learn
						about. I was also completely unaware that he had never wrote anything down. Mostly what has been written
						was
						from his students like Plato. Anyway This was a fun project. I tried to design the page as minimal as
						possible
						with key points and Visual stimulation at the fore front for an all around pleasant experience-->
