                    <h3>Who was Socrates?</h3>
                </header>

                <p>
                    <span class="pgraph first-letter--fancy">S</span>ocrates was born 469BC in Athens and died in 399
                    BCE. He was an ancient Greek philosopher. His lifestyle, character, and thoughts have had a profound
                    impact on both ancient and modern philosophy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Socrates did not write anything, our understanding of his personality and teachings primarily
                    comes from the dialogues of Plato, the Memorabilia of Xenophon, and various writings of Aristotle.
                    Socrates was a brave soldier in the Peloponnesian War and later served in the Athenian assembly.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img class="who__img" alt="painting of socrates"
                        src="https://faqszone.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/S%C3%B3crates.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Socrates believed it was his religious duty to encourage his fellow citizens to lead an examined
                    life by engaging them in philosophical conversations. His contribution to these discussions often
                    involved a series of probing questions that gradually exposed his conversation partner's complete
                    lack of knowledge on the subject. This teaching technique is known as the "Socratic method."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite often claiming ignorance on many subjects he explored, mainly ethical ones, Socrates held
                    certain beliefs with conviction. These included the idea that human wisdom begins with recognizing
                    one's own ignorance, that an unexamined life is not worth living, that ethical virtue is the only
                    thing that matters, and that a good person can never be harmed because their virtue remains intact
                    regardless of misfortune.
                </p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    Among his students and admirers were Plato, Alcibiades, who betrayed Athens in the Peloponnesian
                    War, and Critias, one of the Thirty Tyrants imposed on Athens after its defeat by Sparta. Socrates'
                    association with these men, along with his habit of exposing the ignorance of his fellow citizens,
                    made him widely disliked and feared. As a result, Socrates was tried on charges of impiety and
                    corrupting the youth and was sentenced to death by poisoning (likely hemlock) in 399 BCE, a sentence
                    he accepted willingly.

                <h3>The Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Plato's Apology is believed to be the speech Socrates gave in his defense. As portrayed in the
                    Apology, Socrates' trial and death raise important questions about democracy, the value of free
                    speech, and the potential conflict between moral and religious obligations and the laws of the
                    state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Plato’s Apology(29a-b), Socrates agues that he does not fear death; indeed, to fear death is a
                    sign of ignorance. It is to claim to know what one in fact does not know (Ap. 29 a-b). Perhaps,
                    Socrates suggests, death is not a great evil after all, but
                    "the greatest of all goods.”
                    At the end of the dialogue, after the judges have voted on the final verdict and Socrates has
                    received the death penalty, the philosopher considers two common views of death: that death is a
                    long dreamless sleep and that death is a journey to another place - Hades. According to Socrates,
                    either of these views of death would be acceptable to him; the one, because he would receive a
                    wonderful rest with no dreams to disturb him; the other, because he would be able to talk philosophy
                    with those who had gone before with impunity.

                <h3>The Paintings</h3>

                <p>
                    The Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate)
                    is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting was part of
                    the neoclassical style, popular in the 1780s, that depicted subjects from the Classical age, in this
                    case the story ofthe execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo. In this story, Socrates
                    has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been
                    sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his
                    pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo depicts the
                    death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final
                    days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.

        Authors Thoughts

        When I first started this project for
        freeCodeCamp's
        Responsive Web Design course, I originally wanted to use
        Fredrich Neitszche, not that there is anything wrong with Neitszche. I just felt there were already a ton of
        pages dedicated to him and I wanted to learn about someone new. I had heard Socrates was one of the originals so
        i figured id dive into who he was and what his gig was. I found Socrates to be a a nice release from the
        philosophy i have tried to dive into before. He questioned everything, which is something I believe is
        Important. His morals intrigued me and felt familiar It is said the he had said "" I believe asking questions is
        where we gain not only knowledge but also Character. I found Socrates to be an interesting subject to learn
        about. I was also completely unaware that he had never wrote anything down. Mostly what has been written was
        from his students like Plato. Anyway This was a fun project. I tried to design the page as minimal as possible
        with key points and Visual stimulation at the fore front for an all around pleasant experience
